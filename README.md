# Data Collection:
The collected data is contained in a folder organized with  data associated with certain hypotheses in the study. 
The .csv files also list some specifics about the data (e.g. it was collected with no obstructions in the way)

#### .csv files containing data collected at different distances
### Hypothesis_2 data
