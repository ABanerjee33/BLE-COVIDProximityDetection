# piPACT
This repo contains the data, spreadsheets, and code I used in my piPACT independent Study Project. 

# Data Collection:
The collected data is contained in a folder organized with  data associated with certain hypotheses in the study. 
The .csv files also list some specifics about the data (e.g. it was collected with no obstructions in the way)
