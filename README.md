The .csv files also list some specifics about the data (e.g. it was collected with no obstructions in the way)

## Data File

#### .csv files containing data collected at different distances
### Hypothesis_2 data
#### .csv files containing data collected with different obstructions (e.g. person)
### Hypothesis 3 & 4 data
#### .csv files containing data collected with different TX power configurations (e.g. 2)
### Hypothesis 5 data (also applicable to hypothesis 1)
#### .csv files containing data collected at different distances outside
### Hypothesis 6 data
#### .csv files containing data collected at different orientations (e.g. up:90 deg, down: -90 deg, etc.)
